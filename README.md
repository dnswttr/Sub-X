# Sub-X Substructure Extractor

This is Sub-X a tool that extracts substructures from 2D and 3D data cubes. This repository contains two files:

- main.py: this is the main function, here you set all the input parameters and you run main

- subX.py: these are the actual functions of the extraction 

The mink functions are used to determine the geometrical shapes of the structures extracted with Sub-X:

- mink.py: this is the main function, here you set all the input parameters and you run mink

- mink_functions.py: these are the actual functions used to compute the geometerical shapes
